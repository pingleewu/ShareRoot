        Chaco is a Python plotting application toolkit that facilitates writing
        plotting applications at all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with
        hard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data interrelationships
        and a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco generates attractive static
        plots for publication and presentation, it also works well for interactive data
        visualization and exploration.
        
        Features
        --------
        - **Flexible drawing and layout**: Plots consist of graphical components which
          can be placed inside nestable containers for layout, positioning, and event
          dispatch. Every component has a configurable rendering loop with distinct
          layers and backbuffering. Containers can draw cooperatively so that layers
          span across the containment hierarchy.
        - **Modular and extensible architecture**: Chaco is object-oriented from the
          ground up for ease of extension and customization. There are clear interfaces
          and abstract classes defining extension points for writing your own custom
          behaviors, from custom tools, plot types, layouts, etc. Most classes are
          also "subclass-friendly", so that subclasses can override one or two methods
          and everything else just works.
        - **Data model for ease of extension and embedding**: Chaco separates the data
          from any transformations of the data that are needed for displaying it. This
          separation makes it easier to extend Chaco, or embed it in applications.
